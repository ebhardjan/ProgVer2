WlpStar
=======

Contains test cases (.vpr files) that already are in DSA reduced to the four statements:
* ```s1; s2```
* ```s1 [] s2```
* ```assume A```
* ```assert A```

Filenames
---------

Into the filenames is encoded how many assertions are excepted "might-fail".
The filenames are of the form:
```<anything you want>-amfc-<expected assertion-might-fail-count>.vpr```
